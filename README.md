# Human-Sense
Senior Capstone Project

<b>
Goal: Design and build an affordable tracking system to identify
individual(s) in areas where security cameras are prohibited.
</b>

<b>
Motivation: Surveillance cameras in public settings such as bathrooms
are prohibited. With school violence increasing, identifying
the location of individual(s) at any place and time while
maintaining privacy laws is crucial.
