# HTMS: Human Tracking Monitoring System
Senior Capstone Project

## Goal
Design and build an affordable tracking system to track
individual(s) in areas where security cameras are prohibited.

## Motivation
Surveillance cameras in public settings such as bathrooms
are prohibited. With school violence increasing, identifying
the location of individual(s) at any place and time while
maintaining privacy laws is crucial.
